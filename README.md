## About Me

Iâ€™m a Python developer passionate about building scalable and efficient backend solutions. I specialize in crafting RESTful APIs, implementing security best practices, working with relational and non-relational databases, and integrating third-party services. This repository is a showcase of my backend development expertise, designed using Python frameworks such as Flask and Django.

Feel free to explore the projects below and see how I handle different backend challenges!
